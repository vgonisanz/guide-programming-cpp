# Guide programming cpp

**WARNING** I'm not a senior programmer. I just try to code in the better way I can.
I don't know if this repository is enougth good to learn, if I will complete it in
a near future, etc... Still in **develop**. No guarantee!!!

Programming is an art. If someone say the oposite, he doesn't like programming or
he doesn't understand what really is. I'm creating this repository to improve my
own abilities with cpp, and maybe this will help you to learn a bit. At least,
I will group several interesting resources here.

# Compiling

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
make install
```

# Resources

* [Isocpp C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#main)
* [Isocpp FAQ](https://isocpp.org/faq). Interesting resource to learn about standard stuff.
* [c++ con clase](http://c.conclase.net/curso/index.php). In spanish, good place, I started learning here.
* [MITx: 6.005.1x: Software Construction in Java (for newbies)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.005.1x+3T2016/course/). Please, don't kill me, this course is on Java I know, but the language is not important here. This is a very good resource to learn about good practices programming and part of I learn was taken from here.
* [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). If you call developer yourself, then you **NEED** to use git (or other software for control version). Please, LEARN.
* [Git methodology](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). If you know git commands, you still don't know how to work. Take a look to this methodology.
